| **Layer 5**  | **Session**         | The **Session Layer** manages and controls the dialogues (sessions) between computers. It establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between applications. This layer is responsible for setting up, coordinating, and terminating exchanges between applications. It provides services such as dialog control, token management, and synchronization, allowing systems to coordinate when and how long they transmit data. The Session Layer handles session checkpointing and recovery, so that if a failure occurs, only the data after the last checkpoint needs to be retransmitted.                                                                                                        | - **Session Establishment:** Initiates and negotiates sessions between applications.<br>- **Session Maintenance:** Keeps sessions alive and manages exchanges during the communication process.<br>- **Session Termination:** Gracefully closes sessions, ensuring all data is properly exchanged.<br>- **Synchronization:** Implements checkpoints in data streams for recovery from failures.<br>- **Dialog Control:** Manages whether the communication is half-duplex or full-duplex.                                                                                                    | - **NetBIOS** (Session services over networks)<br>- **RPC** (Remote procedure calls)<br>- **PPTP** (VPN tunneling)<br>- **SOCKS** (Proxy protocol)                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | - Session Layer protocols often rely on the Transport Layer for data transfer.<br>- **RPC uses TCP or UDP** for communication.<br>- Facilitates coordination and organization of communication sessions between applications.                                                                                                                    |
| **Layer 4**  | **Transport**       | The **Transport Layer** provides transparent transfer of data between end systems and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control. It ensures complete data transfer with reliable and sequential packet delivery.

| **Layer 3**  | **Network**         | The **Network Layer** is responsible for the logical addressing and routing of data packets across multiple networks to reach their destination. It manages packet forwarding, including routing through intermediate routers, and handles fragmentation and reassembly of packets. The Network Layer determines the optimal path through the network by considering factors like network conditions, priority of service, and other parameters. It translates logical addresses and names into physical addresses, enabling devices to be uniquely identified on the network and ensuring that data is delivered to the correct destination.                                                   | - **Logical Addressing:** Assigns and manages IP addresses for devices to identify them across networks.<br>- **Routing:** Determines and manages the best path for data to travel through the network.<br>- **Packet Forwarding:** Moves packets between networks via routers.<br>- **Fragmentation and Reassembly:** Splits packets into smaller units when necessary and reassembles them at the destination.<br>- **Error Handling and Diagnostics:** Provides error reporting and diagnostic functions (e.g., ICMP).                                                               | - **IP** (IPv4, IPv6)<br>- **ICMP** (Error messaging and diagnostics)<br>- **IGMP** (Multicast group management)<br>- **IPsec** (Secure IP communication)<br>- **Routing Protocols:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **RIP** (Distance-vector routing)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **OSPF** (Link-state routing)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **BGP** (Inter-domain routing)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **IS-IS** (Link-state routing protocol)<br>- **IPX** (Novell NetWare protocol) | - **IP provides services to Transport Layer protocols** like TCP and UDP.<br>- **Routing protocols** enable routers to exchange routing information and determine optimal paths.<br>- Handles logical addressing, distinct from physical addressing at the Data Link Layer.                                                                  |
| **Layer 2**  | **Data Link**       | The **Data Link Layer** provides reliable node-to-node data transfer by detecting and possibly correcting errors that may occur in the Physical Layer. It structures the raw bitstream from the Physical Layer into frames (structured units of data) and provides physical addressing through MAC addresses. The Data Link Layer controls access to the physical transmission medium using protocols that manage when a device can transmit data (e.g., CSMA/CD for Ethernet). It ensures that data frames are transferred reliably over the physical link, handling errors in the physical layer, flow control, and frame synchronization. This layer is often divided into two sublayers: Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC). | - **Framing:** Packages raw bits into frames with headers and trailers.<br>- **Physical Addressing:** Uses MAC addresses to identify devices on the same local network segment.<br>- **Error Detection and Correction:** Implements error checking using CRC and can request retransmission of corrupted frames.<br>- **Flow Control:** Prevents a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver by regulating data transmission rate.<br>- **Access Control:** Determines which device has control of the transmission medium at any given time (e.g., CSMA/CD, token passing).                                                      | - **Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)**<br>- **Wi-Fi MAC Layer (IEEE 802.11)**<br>- **PPP** (Point-to-Point Protocol)<br>- **HDLC** (Synchronous data link control)<br>- **Frame Relay** (Packet-switched WAN protocol)<br>- **ATM** (Cell relay protocol)<br>- **Token Ring** (IBM network protocol)<br>- **FDDI** (Fiber optic network protocol)                                                                                                   | - Provides reliable transmission between two directly connected nodes.<br>- **MAC addresses** are used for local network communication, distinct from IP addresses at the Network Layer.<br>- Works closely with the Physical Layer to transmit data over physical media.                                                                                         |
| **Layer 1**  | **Physical**        | The **Physical Layer** is the lowest layer of the OSI model and is responsible for the physical connection between devices. It defines the electrical, mechanical, procedural, and functional specifications for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the physical link between communicating network systems. This layer deals with the transmission and reception of raw bitstreams over a physical medium, including the layout of pins, voltages, cable specifications, modulation, signal strength, synchronization, and data rates.

**Notes on Inter-Layer Relationships:**

- **Higher layers depend on the services of lower layers.** For example:
  - The **Application Layer** relies on the **Transport Layer** for data transfer.
  - The **Transport Layer** uses the **Network Layer** for routing packets.
  - The **Network Layer** uses the **Data Link Layer** for node-to-node data transfer.
  - The **Data Link Layer** interfaces with the **Physical Layer** for transmission over the physical medium.

- **Protocol Stacking:**
  - Protocols are stacked on top of each other, where each layer adds its own header information.
  - An **HTTP request** (Application Layer) is encapsulated within a **TCP segment** (Transport Layer), which is then encapsulated within an **IP packet** (Network Layer), and finally within an **Ethernet frame** (Data Link Layer) before being transmitted over the physical medium.

- **TCP/IP Suite Integration:**
  - In practical implementations, the OSI model layers are often mapped to the TCP/IP model:
    - **Application Layer** (combines OSI Layers 5-7)
    - **Transport Layer** (OSI Layer 4)
    - **Internet Layer** (OSI Layer 3)
    - **Network Interface Layer** (combines OSI Layers 1-2)
