**Understanding Protocol Dependencies:**

- **Application Layer Protocols** rely on **Transport Layer Protocols** (e.g., HTTP relies on TCP).
- **Transport Layer Protocols** rely on the **Network Layer Protocol** (IP) for addressing and routing.
- **Network Layer Protocols** use **Data Link Layer Protocols** (e.g., Ethernet) to send packets over physical networks.
- **Data Link Layer Protocols** interact with the **Physical Layer** for transmission over the medium (e.g., copper cables, fiber optics).
